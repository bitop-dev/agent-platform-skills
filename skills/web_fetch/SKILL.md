# Web Fetch

Fetch a URL and return the page's main content as clean markdown. Strips navigation, ads, scripts, and boilerplate — returns only the readable article/page content.

Runs as a sandboxed WebAssembly module — no Python, no pip, no BeautifulSoup, no external dependencies. Uses regex-based HTML extraction compiled to WASM.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**
- You found a relevant URL from `web_search` and need the full content
- The user gave you a URL to read
- You need to read documentation, blog posts, or articles
- The search snippet wasn't enough to answer the question

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**
- The `web_search` snippet already answers the question — don't fetch unnecessarily
- You need to call a JSON API — use the `http_fetch` core tool instead
- The URL points to a local file — use `read_file`
- The URL is a PDF, image, or binary file — this only handles HTML pages

## Tips

1. **Check the snippet first** — If `web_search` already gave you a useful snippet, don't fetch the full page
2. **Use `max_chars` wisely** — For quick lookups, 5000 chars is usually enough. For full documentation pages, use the default 20000
3. **One page at a time** — Don't fetch 10 URLs in parallel. Read one, see if it answers the question, then fetch another only if needed
4. **Watch for errors** — Some sites block automated requests. If a fetch fails, try a different URL from your search results

## Sandbox Requirements

- **Network**: Target URL's host must be in AllowedHosts (or use `["*"]` wildcard)
- **Filesystem**: none required
- **Dependencies**: none — single .wasm binary
